description: Audit a Power Pages classic portal's Web Roles, Table Permissions, Site Settings, and Web API configuration for misalignments — orphaned permissions, missing Webapi/<entity>/enabled site settings, exposed `fields = *` whitelists, broken polymorphic lookups in custom JS, anonymous-role exposure, performance bottlenecks (N+1 queries), and metadata gaps (missing snippets). Use when the user reports unexpected 401/403/404 from /_api/, missing data, slow page loads, role-specific access bugs, or wants a portal security/quality review. NOT for code sites.

# Power Pages Permissions & Quality Audit

Static analysis of a Power Pages classic site's configuration. The skill reads YAML metadata, Liquid templates, and custom JavaScript, cross-references findings, and produces a prioritized report of security risks, performance bottlenecks, and metadata misalignments.

## When to apply

User says any of:

- "audit my Power Pages permissions"
- "review the portal security/quality"
- "I'm getting 401 / 403 / 404 from /_api/<something> — why?"
- "this page works for me but not for <other-user>"
- "make sure I'm not exposing any sensitive fields"
- "why is this page so slow to load?"
- "I'm seeing blank content where a snippet should be"
- "did I miss any FetchXML best practices?"

## How this skill works

1. **Detect the site folder** — `<site>---<site>/` containing `web-pages/`, `web-templates/`, `table-permissions/`, `web-roles/`, `site-settings/`. If multiple sites exist (Modernization Suite), ask the user which one.
2. **Run the audit script** — `scripts/audit.py <site-folder>`. The script reads YAML and JS files and emits a structured report.
3. **Interpret the findings** — the script identifies issues but the *fix* depends on the user's intent. Walk through findings with the user.
4. **Optionally write fixes** — only after the user picks which findings to address. Never auto-apply fixes.

## Running the audit

```bash
python3 <skill-path>/scripts/audit.py <site-folder>
```

The script is **stdlib only** (no `pip install` needed) — Power Pages YAML is flat enough to parse with `re`. If the user wants more rigorous YAML parsing, they can `pip install pyyaml` and the script will use it automatically when available.

Output is markdown:

```markdown
# Power Pages Permissions Audit Report
Site: <name>  Path: <path>  Generated: <timestamp>

## Summary
- ERROR    3
- WARN     8
- INFO    12

## Findings

### ERROR-001: WebAPI enabled but no Table Permission
Entity: contoso_contractor
...
```

## What this skill audits

See [checks.md](references/checks.md) for the full list. Highlights:

| Severity | Check |
|---|---|
| ERROR | Web API enabled (`Webapi/<entity>/enabled = true`) but no Table Permission grants Read for any Web Role |
| ERROR | Table Permission with empty `adx_webroles` array (orphaned) |
| ERROR | Anonymous Users role granted Write/Delete on a sensitive table |
| ERROR | `Webapi/<entity>/Fields` explicitly whitelists field-secured readable columns |
| INFO | Table Permission grants Read but Web API site setting is missing — Web API will 404 |
| INFO | Web Page requires authentication but no Web Role rule (any auth user can see) |
| WARN | Custom JS has `<lookup>@odata.bind` without `_contact` / `_account` suffix on a polymorphic field — runtime 400 |
| WARN | Web Role exists but no Table Permission references it |
| WARN | `Webapi/<entity>/Fields = *` on an entity that has field-secured readable columns |
| WARN | Liquid references `snippets['Name']` that isn't defined locally (also covers Sitemarkers) |
| WARN | Basic Form references a field that does not exist in the schema |
| INFO | **N+1 query pattern detected in Liquid (lookup inside `{% for %}`)** |
| INFO | **`{% fetchxml %}` block is missing a `count` attribute** |
| WARN | **Site Setting appears to contain a secret and is visible to portal** |

## Interpreting findings

Three categories of fix:

1. **Add missing config**: Web API site setting is missing — add it to `site-settings/`
2. **Tighten config**: `fields = *` is broader than necessary — narrow to a whitelist
3. **Remove dead config**: orphaned permission with no roles — delete the YAML file

The script flags issues. **You** make the call about which to fix and how — based on whether the data is genuinely sensitive, whether the role is intended to have access, etc. Always discuss findings with the user before applying fixes.

See [interpreting.md](references/interpreting.md) and [remediation.md](references/remediation.md) for guidance on each finding type.

## What this skill does NOT do

- **Auto-apply fixes** — every fix is proposed to the user, not applied automatically. Permissions changes affect security; the user must approve each one.
- **Live-query Dataverse** — this is static analysis of the local site source. It can't verify whether a Web Role is actually assigned to specific Contacts (that lives in Dataverse, not the site source). For live verification, use the `dataverse` plugin (`dv-query`) to inspect Dataverse directly.
- **Audit Dataverse-side security** — System User roles, security roles on entities, business unit boundaries are out of scope. This skill audits the **portal layer** only.
- **Replace manual security review** — the audit catches misalignments it can detect statically. It cannot judge whether the portal's intended security model is correct in the first place; that's a human decision.

## Audit script

The audit logic lives in `scripts/audit.py`. Read it to understand the exact checks. To extend the audit:

1. Add a `check_*` function in `audit.py`
2. Call it from `main()`
3. Document the new check in `references/checks.md`
