# Remediation Guide

How to fix each finding type. **Apply fixes only after the user has approved each one** — permissions changes affect security.

## ERR-001 — Web API enabled but no Table Permission

### Decision: keep the Web API, add a permission

If something genuinely needs to call `/_api/<entity>`:

1. Identify the calling Web Role(s)
2. Decide on Scope: Global / Account / Contact / Self / Parent
3. Decide on Operations: Read only, or Read + Write etc.
4. Create Table Permission YAML:

```yaml
# table-permissions/<descriptive-name>.tablepermission.yml
adx_entitylogicalname: <entity>
adx_entityname: <Descriptive Display Name>
adx_scope: 1            # 1=Global, 2=Account, 3=Contact, 4=Self, 5=Parent
adx_read: true
adx_create: false
adx_write: false
adx_delete: false
adx_append: false
adx_appendto: false
adx_entitypermission_webrole:
  - <role-guid-1>
  - <role-guid-2>
```

5. Sync: `pac paportal upload --path . --modelVersion 2`
6. Verify the calling code now succeeds

### Decision: remove the Web API setting

If nothing actually calls `/_api/<entity>` (dead config):

1. Find the site setting in `sitesetting.yml` (consolidated style) or `site-settings/<file>.sitesetting.yml`
2. Set `statecode: 1` (inactive) — or delete the setting outright if it was added by mistake
3. Sync

## ERR-002 — Orphaned Table Permission

### Decision: re-attach to a role

If the permission represents real intent that just lost its role assignment:

1. Open the permission YAML
2. Add the appropriate Web Role GUID(s) to `adx_entitypermission_webrole`
3. Sync

### Decision: delete

If the permission is dead config (a duplicate or a leftover from an experiment):

1. Verify in Power Pages Studio that no role currently references it
2. Delete the YAML file
3. Sync — the upload will detect and remove the permission record

## ERR-003 — Anonymous role with write operations

### Decision: tighten

If the operation should be authenticated only:

1. Open the permission YAML
2. Replace the Anonymous Users role GUID with the appropriate authenticated role GUID
3. Sync

### Decision: keep but constrain

If anonymous create is genuinely needed (public contact form etc.):

1. Verify `adx_create: true` only — `adx_read`, `adx_write`, `adx_delete` should be `false`
2. Add a narrow `Webapi/<entity>/Fields` whitelist — never `*`
3. Configure CAPTCHA on the form (Site Setting `Authentication/Registration/CaptchaEnabled = true` and `Authentication/Registration/Captcha/<page>` references)
4. Add server-side validation via plugins if write is allowed

## WRN-001 — Polymorphic lookup without disambiguator

1. Identify the entity that owns this lookup. Look at the calling URL to infer which table the new record is being created in.
2. Read `dataverse-schema/<solution>/Entities/<entity>/Entity.xml`
3. Find the lookup attribute by name. If `Type="customer"`, the field is polymorphic.
4. Determine which target (Contact or Account) the calling code intends:
   - Contact: change to `<lookup>_contact@odata.bind` and the URI to `/contacts(<guid>)`
   - Account: change to `<lookup>_account@odata.bind` and the URI to `/accounts(<guid>)`
5. Test the affected page/flow before deploying

If the field isn't polymorphic, the original binding is correct — close the finding as false-positive.

## WRN-002 — Orphaned Web Role

### Decision: assign permissions

If the role should grant access but currently doesn't:

1. Decide what the role should be able to do
2. Create or update Table Permissions to include this role's GUID in `adx_entitypermission_webrole`

### Decision: keep for page-level access

If the role is intentionally page-only (no record-level permissions):

1. Verify it's referenced in `web-pages/**/*.webpage.yml` Web Role rules
2. Document the intent in your project notes — this finding will recur otherwise

### Decision: delete

If the role is genuinely obsolete:

1. Confirm no Contacts are assigned to this role (in Studio: Web Roles → the role → Contacts tab)
2. Confirm no page rules reference it
3. Delete the role from `webrole.yml` (or its per-file YAML)
4. Sync

## INFO-001 — Permission without Web API

If client-side `/_api/<entity>` calls are intended:

1. Add `Webapi/<entity>/Enabled = true` to `sitesetting.yml`
2. Add `Webapi/<entity>/Fields = <comma,separated,list>` (NEVER `*` for sensitive entities)
3. Sync

If access is purely server-side via FetchXML in Liquid: leave as-is, this finding is informational.

## INFO-002 — Fields wildcard

1. Identify the calling code: which fields does it actually need?
2. Build the comma-separated whitelist from `<select>` clauses in custom JS and FetchXML attributes in templates
3. Replace `Webapi/<entity>/Fields` value from `*` to the explicit list
4. Test all calling code to confirm nothing references a field that was implicitly exposed by `*`
5. Sync

The transition from `*` to a whitelist often catches dead code that was reading fields nobody knew were exposed.

## INFO-003 — Page requires auth but no role rule

1. Decide which roles should access this page
2. In Studio: Page → Permissions → Web Roles → Add (or edit `webpageaccesscontrolrule` and link to the page)
3. Sync

If the intent IS "any authenticated user," document it explicitly so the finding is dismissable next time.

## INFO-004 — Junction not exported

This is informational only. To get role-aware audit checks:

- Update `pac paportal` to the latest version (`pac install latest`)
- Re-export with the new version
- The export should now include `adx_entitypermission_webrole` inline

If updating PAC isn't an option, the audit's entity-level checks (ERR-001, INFO-001, INFO-002, INFO-003) still work — only role-aware checks (ERR-002, ERR-003, WRN-002) are skipped.

## After applying fixes

1. **Re-run the audit** to confirm the finding is resolved
2. **Sync up**: `pac paportal upload --path . --modelVersion 2`
3. **Test in browser**: load the affected page or call the affected `/_api/<entity>` endpoint
4. **Commit** with a clear message linking the finding code(s) you addressed

## What to do when in doubt

For any finding you're not sure about:

1. Don't apply a "fix" — it might break the intended behavior
2. Talk to whoever set up the original permissions config
3. If nobody remembers, do a controlled experiment: change one finding, test, observe, then either keep or revert
