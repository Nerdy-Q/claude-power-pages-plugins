# Contract tests for the pac CLI surface that pp-sync depends on.
#
# Defines, in code, what pp's parsers expect from each `pac` subcommand:
#   - which strings/patterns must appear in stdout
#   - which exit codes count as success/failure
#   - what filesystem effects must occur
#
# These contracts are the load-bearing assumptions in `bin/pp`'s
# integration with pac. The mock at tests/mocks/pac MUST satisfy them
# for the mocked test suite to be a faithful stand-in.
#
# Two run modes:
#
#   bash test_pac_contract.sh            # default: against the mock pac
#   PP_PAC_REAL=1 bash test_pac_contract.sh
#                                         # against the real pac CLI
#
# CI runs the default mode (mock). Maintainers run the PP_PAC_REAL=1
# mode before each release to catch drift between real pac and the
# mock — this is the regression that the v2.10.0 changelog acknowledged
# but didn't have automated coverage for.
#
# Contract failures from EITHER mode are real bugs:
#   - mock fails contract → mock needs updating to match real pac
#   - real pac fails contract → pp's parsers will break on this pac
#     version; pp needs adjusting
