# Changelog

All notable changes to this marketplace are documented here. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), with version numbers tracking the marketplace as a whole. Per-plugin versions live in each `plugins/<name>/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and are noted below where they advance.

## [2.2.0] — 2026-04-29

### Added (pp-portal v2.1.0)
- **`references/recipes/`** — five step-by-step walkthroughs (1,608 lines total) covering complete production patterns end-to-end:
  - `paginated-list-page.md` — server-rendered list with search and pagination
  - `hybrid-form-with-safeajax.md` — Liquid form chrome + JS Web API submit
  - `dependent-dropdown.md` — cascading select boxes via `/_api/`
  - `file-upload-annotations.md` — multi-file upload via `/_api/annotations`
  - `role-gated-section.md` — show/hide UI by Web Role (server-side + defensive client)
- New "Recipes" section in SKILL.md routing to all five.

### Added (pp-sync v1.4.0)
- **`pp diff <project>`** subcommand — preview what `pp up` would push before running. Categorizes changed files (Liquid pages, JS, CSS, config, permissions, site settings, etc.), counts each category, warns on bulk-upload risk. Optional flags: `--diff` (line-level git diff stat), `--names-only` (pipe-friendly).

### Added (pp-permissions-audit v1.3.0)
- **`examples/git-hooks/`** — drop-in pre-commit hook template with one-step installer:
  - `pre-commit` — auto-detects site folder, runs `audit.py --severity ERROR --exit-code`, blocks commit on findings
  - `install-hook.sh` — backs up existing hook, symlinks template, chmods +x
  - `README.md` — install/bypass/uninstall + pre-commit-vs-CI rationale
- `CI.md` updated with full "Git pre-commit hook" section including pre-commit-vs-CI comparison table.

### Changed
- CHANGELOG.md updated for v2.2.0.

## [2.1.0] — 2026-04-29

### Added
- **GitHub Action for marketplace validation** (`.github/workflows/plugin-validate.yml`): plugin manifest structural checks, SKILL.md frontmatter validation, audit.py compile check, bash syntax check, internal markdown link integrity, and client-identifier leak guard. Runs on every PR and push to main.
- **Bash and zsh completion for `pp` CLI** (`plugins/pp-sync/completion/`): subcommand completion + dynamic project-name completion from `~/.config/nq-pp-sync/projects/`. Installer (`pp-sync/install.sh`) auto-installs them when `~/.bash_completion.d/` or `~/.zsh/completions/` is present.
- **CHANGELOG.md** at repo root (this file).
- Backfilled GitHub Release pages for v1.1.0 and v1.2.0 tags.

### Changed
- README badge updated from "classic" to "hybrid" to reflect the v2.0.0 scope reframing.

## [2.0.0] — 2026-04-29

### Breaking
- **Plugin renamed**: `pp-liquid` → `pp-portal`. Reinstall path: `claude plugin uninstall pp-liquid@nq-claude-plugins && claude plugin install pp-portal@nq-claude-plugins`.
- **References reorganized** into 5 category subdirectories: `language/`, `data/`, `pages/`, `workflow/`, `quality/`. Internal links updated automatically; any external bookmarks need updating to `references/<category>/<file>.md`.

### Added
- **Three new reference files** in pp-portal:
  - `language/types.md` — 7 documented Liquid types, truthiness rules, type coercion patterns
  - `data/site-settings.md` — comprehensive site setting catalog (Webapi/*, Authentication/*, Search/*, HTTP/*, Site/*, Profile/*) with case-sensitivity rule and CSP deep dive
  - `workflow/microsoft-plugins.md` — companion-plugin guidance, when to defer to Microsoft's `dataverse`, `power-pages`, `canvas-apps`, `model-apps` plugins
- **Two new reference files from the styling pass**:
  - `pages/styling-and-design.md` — CSS architecture, theme system, page templates vs web templates, Bootstrap 3 vs 5 implications
  - `pages/bundled-libraries.md` — jQuery 3.6.2, jQuery UI 1.13.2, Bootstrap version inventory
- **Accessibility reference**: `quality/accessibility.md` — WCAG 2.2 conformance, Section 508, EN 301 549. No built-in checker — use Accessibility Insights externally.
- **`language/operators.md`** — operator inventory + truthiness rules with surprising-cases warning.
- **Casing as 4th critical gotcha** in SKILL.md — Logical / Schema / Display / Entity Set Name + Navigation Property four-name model.

### Changed (corrections from MS Learn verification)
- **Date format strings**: corrected from strftime (`%Y`, `%m`, `%-d`) to .NET format strings (`'yyyy'`, `'MMMM dd, yyyy'`). Every date example in 4+ files updated.
- **Filters reference**: removed 17+ filters that don't exist in Power Pages (`strip`, `lstrip`, `rstrip`, `slice`, `sort`, `sort_natural`, `uniq`, `compact`, `reverse`, `map`, `where_exp`, `escape_once`, `url_encode`, `abs`, `to_string`, `current_culture`, `display_name`, `metafield`, `json`). Added missing canonical filters (`batch`, `except`, `group_by`, `order_by`/`then_by`, `random`, `shuffle`, `select`, `skip`, `take`, all `date_add_*`, `html_safe_escape`, `xml_escape`, `text_to_html`, all URL filters).
- **Tags**: added missing canonical tags (`{% entityview %}` — required for entitylist row rendering, `{% searchindex %}`, `{% powerbi %}`, `{% codecomponent %}`, `{% substitution %}`, `{% comment %}`, `{% raw %}`, plus all control-flow/iteration/variable tags). Fixed entitylist attributes (id|name|key + language_code only — page/sort/search are on entityview). Fixed include syntax (comma-separated `key:value`, not Shopify's `with`). Fixed editable defaults (`liquid:true` is default, not opt-in).
- **Web API**: added the canonical Microsoft jQuery `safeAjax` with `validateLoginSession` alongside the modernized fetch version. Added `PUT` single-property update and `$ref` associate/disassociate operations. Removed unsupported "OData v4 headers required" claim.
- **Site settings case**: corrected from PascalCase to lowercase per MS convention (`Webapi/<entity>/enabled` not `/Enabled`). Renamed `Webapi/error/innererror/enabled` to `Webapi/error/innererror`. Renamed `Webapi/<entity>/disablefilter` to `Webapi/<entity>/disableodatafilter`. Added the 50+ unsupported `adx_*` config-tables list.
- **FetchXML**: softened "`mapping=logical` required" (technically optional per MS). Added FetchXML attribute reference per MS. Added the self-closing `<attribute/>` ban gotcha.
- **Companion-plugin posture**: SKILL.md now explicitly defers to Microsoft's plugins for Dataverse-side work (`dv-connect`, `dv-query`, `dv-metadata`, `dv-solution`, `dv-admin`, `dv-security`), code sites, canvas apps, model-driven apps.

### Repo housekeeping
- README updated with category breakdown for pp-portal
- CONTRIBUTING.md updated with new subdirectory paths
- marketplace.json: pp-portal entry with new description and tags including `hybrid` and `classic-portal`
- Plugin folder rename via `git mv` preserves history

## [1.2.0] — 2026-04-29

### Added (pp-permissions-audit)
- **3 schema-aware audit checks** (only run when `dataverse-schema/` is in the repo):
  - **WRN-006**: `$select=<field>` references a field that doesn't exist on the entity per Entity.xml
  - **WRN-007**: FetchXML attribute does not exist on its entity per Entity.xml
  - **WRN-008**: `Webapi/<entity>/Fields` whitelist lists nonexistent fields
- Smart skip-list for Microsoft built-in entities (`contact`, `account`, etc.) prevents false positives from partial schema exports.
- Enhanced schema loader captures EntitySetName, lookup `_value` forms, and navigation property names.
- **GitHub Action template** at `examples/github-actions/power-pages-audit.yml` — drop-in workflow that triggers on PRs touching portal source, auto-detects the site folder, gates the PR on ERROR-class findings, uploads the full report as build artifact.
- **CI integration doc** (`CI.md`): GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, generic shell, pre-commit hooks, and JSON output for custom dashboards.

### Fixed (pp-permissions-audit)
- Fixed an orphaned-code bug where the schema loader was never invoked (lived after a `return` statement in `parse_yaml_text`). Schema-aware checks now actually run.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-04-29

### Added (pp-portal)
- **`references/dataverse-naming.md`** — covers the 4-name model (Logical / Schema / Display / Entity Set Name), navigation-property casing rules, where each name applies, common-error decoding.
- Promoted Dataverse casing to the 4th critical gotcha in SKILL.md.

### Added (pp-sync)
- **`pp sync-pages <project>`** subcommand — copies one half of the base/localized pair to the other in bulk for all paired files. Idempotent.

### Added (pp-permissions-audit)
- **WRN-005**: `<prefix_name>@odata.bind` is all lowercase — likely a Logical Name where Navigation Property was needed. Excludes Microsoft built-ins and polymorphic suffixes.
- **INFO-009**: Page has diverged base/localized files. Both populated but differ by >10% in size — inconsistent-content failure mode (mode B; mode A — empty base — remains INFO-005).

### Changed (pp-portal)
- Sharpened the base-vs-localized gotcha in SKILL.md to highlight the maintenance angle: two failure modes (empty base / diverged pair).
- Expanded `hybrid-page-idiom.md` with maintenance patterns and divergence-detection guidance.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-04-28

### Initial public release

Three plugins in the `nq-claude-plugins` marketplace at v1.0.0 each, sanitized and verified leak-free.

#### pp-liquid (v1.0.0)
Knowledge skill for Power Pages classic Liquid templating. 8 reference files covering FetchXML count+paginate+filter, Web API in custom JS with the safeAjax / `__RequestVerificationToken` pattern, entity tags (entitylist, entityform, webform), DotLiquid quirks vs Shopify Liquid, hybrid render-then-mutate pages, and a troubleshooting matrix mapping common errors to causes and fixes.

#### pp-sync (v1.0.0)
Action skill plus `pp` CLI for safe portal sync workflows. Backed by a per-project config registry at `~/.config/nq-pp-sync/projects/` with alias and prefix-match resolution. Subcommands: setup, list, show, switch, status, down, up, doctor, solution-down, solution-up, audit. Cross-plugin audit dispatch. CI-friendly `--severity` / `--exit-code`. Ships 6 standalone wrapper templates as drop-ins for projects that don't want to register globally.

#### pp-permissions-audit (v1.0.0)
Static analysis of Power Pages portal permissions and Web API configuration. Stdlib-only Python script (no `pip install`) runs 13 checks against site source. Catches blank-page bugs (base vs localized file divergence), missing anti-forgery tokens, polymorphic lookup mistakes, orphaned permissions, sitemarker drift, unsafe DotLiquid JSON escapes, and Web API misalignment patterns.

### Repo bootstrap
